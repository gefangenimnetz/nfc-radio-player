.. option:: --wait

   After reading or writing a tag, wait until it is removed before
   returning. This option is implicit when the option ``--loop`` is
   set.

.. option:: --technology {A,B,F}

   Poll only for tags of a specific technology. The technologies
   NFC-A, NFC-B, and NFC-F are defined in the NFC Forum Digital
   Specification. The technology indicator is case insensitive. The
   default is to poll for all technologies.
